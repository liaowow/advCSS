### Main Sass Features
- **Variables**: for resuable values such as colors, font sizes, spacing, etc
- **Nesting**: to nest selectors inside of one another, allowing us to write less code
- **Operators**: for mathematical operations right inside of CSS
- **Partials and imports**: to write CSS in different files and importing them into one single file
- **Mixins**: to write reusable pieces of CSS code
- **Functions**: similar to mixins, but they produce a value that can be used later
- **Extends**: to make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them
- **Control directives**: for writing complex code using conditionals and loops
